# Cake-classification
Image classification through neural networks.
I have 1800 phots of desserts and I want the computer to tell me which one between 15 kinds (apple pie, cannoli, carrot cake, chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, churros, creme brulee, cup cakes, donuts, ice cream, macarons, panna cotta, red velvet cake, tiramisu, waffles) they represent.
